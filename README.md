# Computer Vision Edge Detection & Segmentation using multiple Operators & Algorithms and applying Deep Learning to detect face.

The goal of this notebook is to use different edge detection operators and segmentation techniques, using manual kernels to find out which is best and also applying Deep Learning models to detect face.

Below is the work included in the notebook.

1. Edge detection using Sobel Kernel (Manual Method)
2. Edge detection using Prewitt Kernel (Manual Method)
3. Edge detection using Scharr Kernel (Manual Method)
4. Edge detection using Laplacian Kernel (Manual Method)
5. Canny Edge Detection using Schar Kernel (Manual Method)
6. Image Segmentation using HSV + Thresholding
7. Image Segmentation using SVM & HOG Approach
8. Image Segmentation using K-Means Cluster Approach
9. Image Segmentation using Deep Learning MTCNN
10. Image Segmentation using Deep Learning OpenCV's CVLIB

_Note:_ Please replace the below path with your's folder path for negatives ```negatives_patches = r'<change_with_your_path>'``` under **Image Segmentation using SVM & HOG Approach**
